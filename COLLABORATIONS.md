# Collaborations

* Thanks to Dr. Fruedenthal for code that captures from MP4,  encodes,
  decodes, and converts frames. Specifically, all functions within
  producerConsumer.py contains portions from:
  ~~~
  ExtractFrames.py
  ExtractAndDisplay.py
  ConvertToGrayscale.py
  ~~~
* Further edits as warranted.
